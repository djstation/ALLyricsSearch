ALLyricsSearch
============

A simple Lyrics Search using MusiXMatch APIs.

DEMO HERE ---> http://www.leonardoallegrini.it/projects/allyricssearch/

HOW TO CONFIGURE IT
====================

1) Go to https://developer.musixmatch.com 

2) Sign Up for MusixMatch APIs

3) Login and go on Dashboard --> Applications

4) Copy your API Key and paste it into index.php (at 'INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE')

5) WOW, IT WORKS!

P.S. There are two kinds of MusiXMatch APIs: Commercial and Free. With Free API it can only show 30% of lyrics. With the commercial one, it can show full lyrics.

P.S.S You need to enable cUrl extension on your php.ini file


Hope you like it,
