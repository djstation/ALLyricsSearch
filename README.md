ALLyricsSearch
============

A simple Lyrics Search using MusiXMatch APIs.

HOW TO CONFIGURE IT
====================

1) Go to https://developer.musixmatch.com 
2) Sign Up for MusixMatch APIs
3) Login and go on Dashboard --> Applications
4) Copy your API Key and paste it into index.php (at 'INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE')
5) WOW, IT WORKS!

N.B. There are two kinds of MusiXMatch APIs: Commercial and Free. With Free API it can only show 30% of lyrics. With the commercial one, it can show full lyrics.

Hope you like it,
